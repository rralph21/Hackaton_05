application of the asynchronous JavaScript concepts learned in Module 05.

## Team Members:

-   David N
-   Matthew T
-   Nicole D
-   Ralph V

## Project Requirements
Create a webpage that fetches data from a third-party API or a local JSON file and displays it dynamically using JavaScript.
Utilize asynchronous programming concepts, such as Promises and async/await, to handle data fetching and processing.
Use the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP requests to the chosen API endpoint or load data from a local JSON file.
Parse the fetched data and extract the relevant information using JavaScript.
Display the fetched data on the webpage in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.
Handle potential errors and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
The project should be completed within the allocated class time (maximum 4 hours).
Use GitHub to collaborate and manage your project repository.

## Hackaton development:
Module 5 Hackaton is based on 5 stock(s) and their prices. We decided to design out HTML with a drop down
that fetched key value pairs with an image of trading that covers the background.
We included scripts for validation and to catch errors.
